## MyToken Smart Contract

# Introduction
  
  MyToken is a simple Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity. It includes 
  a function called 'test', which demonstrates the use of the 'assert', 
  'require', and 'revert' statements for validation and error handling.

# Smart Contract Details

* Function: test
  The 'test' function takes a single parameter 'value' of type 'uint256' and 
  returns a boolean value. This function performs the following checks:

1. Assert Statement: It checks if the 'value' is greater than 50 using the 
  'assert' statement. The 'assert' statement is used for internal consistency 
   checks and should never evaluate to 'false'. If the condition is not met, the 
   transaction will fail and any gas spent will be lost.

2. Require Statement: The function uses the 'require' statement to check if the 
   'value' is not equal to 30. The 'require' statement is commonly used for input 
   validation and to enforce preconditions. If the condition is not satisfied, 
   the function will revert and provide the specified error message.

3. Revert Statement: Lastly, the function uses the 'revert' statement with a 
   custom error message to check if the 'value' is equal to 80. The 'revert' 
   statement is useful for providing custom error messages and conditions. If the 
   'value' is 80, the function will 'revert' and display the specified error 
   message.

# Error Handling
  The smart contract includes custom error messages to provide meaningful 
  feedback to users when certain conditions are not met:

* 'Condition not satisfied: value must not be equal to 30': This error is 
  triggered if the 'value' parameter passed to the 'test' function is equal to 
  30, as per the 'require' statement check.
  
* 'Condition not satisfied: value must not be equal to 80': This error is 
   triggered if the 'value' parameter passed to the 'test' function is equal to 
   80, as per the 'revert' statement check.

# Usage

* To use this smart contract, you can deploy it to an Ethereum network of your 
  choice. The contract's functions are pure functions, meaning they do not modify 
  the blockchain's state. Therefore, you can interact with the contract's 
  functions without spending gas.

* You can call the 'test' function by passing a 'uint256' value as an argument. 
  The function will perform the checks based on the conditions mentioned above 
  and provide either a successful response or revert with the appropriate error 
  message.
